# Starting from a file with on read starting at each possible site
Read length is 150 this coverages is approx. 150X. This should remove stochasticity from generation reads with wgsim.

## Todo
* generate different sequencing coverages by Poisson-sampling reads (10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60). Thus lambdas should be n/150
